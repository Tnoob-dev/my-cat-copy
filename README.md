# How to use

Just like the normal cat command, we can write, read, and copy files (mix will arrive later), just having some small differences, below you will see what the use would be like with the cat command and what it would be like using this

## Differences

### To read a file:
  - cat newfile.txt
  - snake rf newfile.txt

### To create a file:
  - cat > newfile.txt
  - snake wf newfile.txt

### To copy the content from a older file to a new file:
  - cat newfile.txt > copyofnewfile.txt
  - snake cf newfile.txt copyofnewfile.txt
